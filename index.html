        Aware it would be easier to enter the United States from Canada, Musk
        applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother. While
        awaiting the documentation, he attended the University of Pretoria for
        five months; this allowed Musk to avoid mandatory service in the South
        African military. Arriving in
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada">Canada</a> in June 1989,
        Musk failed to locate his great-uncle in Montreal and instead stayed at
        a youth hostel. He then traveled west to live with a second-cousin in
        Saskatchewan. He stayed there for a year, working odd jobs at a farm and
        lumber-mill.

        In 1990, Musk entered

          >Queen's University in Kingston</a
        >
        , Ontario. Two years later, he transferred to the University of
        Pennsylvania (UPenn); he graduated in 1997 with a Bachelor of Science
        (BS) degree in economics from the Wharton School and a Bachelor of Arts
        (BA) degree in physics from UPenn School of Arts and Sciences.In 1994,
        Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley during the summer: at energy
        storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute, which researched
        electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and at the Palo
        Alto-based startup

        . In 1995, Musk was accepted to a Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) program
        in materials science at Stanford University in California. Musk
        attempted to get a job at Netscape but never received a response to his
        inquiries. He dropped out of Stanford after two days, deciding instead
        to join the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_boom">Internet boom</a>
        and launch an Internet startup.
